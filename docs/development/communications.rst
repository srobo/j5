Communications
==============

Most of the communications for `j5` occur on GitHub, but there are a few other comms channels that we also make use of.
This page explains what we use each platform for.

GitHub
------

GitHub is a code hosting and project collaboration platform. We use it to track issues and changes for the project, in
addition to hosting our code repositories.

We have a `GitHub organisation`_ which groups all of our repositories together.

We also have casual discussion in ``#kit-software`` on the `Student Robotics Slack`_.

Development of ``j5`` is discussed in Student Robotics Kit Team meetings.
