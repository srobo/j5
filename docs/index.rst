j5 Framework Documentation
==========================

What is j5?
-----------

`j5` is a Python 3 framework that aims to make building consistent APIs for robotics easier. It was created to reduce the replication of effort into developing the separate, yet very similar APIs for several robotics competitions. Combining the common elements into a single library with support for various hardware gives a consistent feel for students and volunteers. This means more time to work on building robots!

Please note that this documentation is not aimed at the average competitor. It is for used by developers of the API, competition volunteers and more advanced students wishing to extend on our API for their robots. Support is discretionary to the individual competition. `j5` will not provide direct support to compeititors at the time of writing.
