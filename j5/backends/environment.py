    A collection of backends that can work together.

    A number of Backends that we wish to use in a grouping, such as those that
    all work together in hardware can be added to this group. We can then pass
    Environments to a Robot object, so that the Robot object can call different
    methods based on where it is being used.

    e.g Hardware Environment

    We have `n` boards of `n` different types. They are all physical hardware.
    We create an Environment containing the Backends to control the physical
    hardware for our boards.

    It is later realised that we want to test code without the physical hardware.
    We can add Console backends to an environment, and instantiate our Robot object
    with that environment, so that the console is manipulated rather than the hardware.

    This allows for a high degree of code reuse and ensures API compatibility in
    different situations.
